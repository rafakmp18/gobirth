# 🎂 GoBirth

GoBirth is a small **CLI application written in Go** that automatically sends birthday greetings via **WhatsApp**.

The source of truth is **Google Calendar**:
- You create a calendar in Google Calendar with the name "gobirth"
- You create birthday events in your calendar
- GoBirth reads those events
- Generates a birthday message (optionally using AI)
- And sends it automatically via WhatsApp

The application is designed to be:
- Simple
- Self-hosted
- CLI-first
- Open source
- Built with good architecture practices (Hexagonal Architecture)
